# migrationServiceProvider

Enable devop style database schema and data migrations in your Silex Application.

## Introduction

Database migrations. One of the hardest topics to tackle in an automated development environment.

This service provider for the brilliant PHP micro-framework Silex gives you an easy access to the bytepark/lib-migration
composer component. The library itself aims to be as flexible to use, as you - the developers wish.

This component, on the other hand, takes away some assumptions from you as developer. The provider aims to help Silex
applications to conform to the devops movement, i.e. it doesn't matter what database has to be migrated or on which 
application node the database migration is triggered, the project will perform the task without any hassle of the 
operations team.

The goal of the component is to provide the user with an easy way to let the application do the dirty work.
